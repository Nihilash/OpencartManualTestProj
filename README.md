# ðŸ›’ OpenCart Manual Testing Project

## ðŸ“– About This Project
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is my **end-to-end manual testing project** on the **OpenCart** e-commerce application (version 4.1.0.3).  
The goal was to simulate a real-world QA process â€” starting from requirement gathering, through detailed test design and execution, and ending with bug reporting and test closure.

I worked on this project as if I were part of a professional QA team:
- Documented requirements into an **FRS (Functional Requirement Specification)**.
- Created a **Test Plan** covering scope, strategy, and timelines.
- Designed **100+ test cases** for different functional areas.
- Executed all tests on a local OpenCart setup deployed using **XAMPP**.
- Reported bugs with proper screenshots and severity levels.
- Managed the Agile workflow entirely in **Jira with Zephyr**.

This project shows my ability to handle **real-world QA responsibilities** from scratch to sign-off.
