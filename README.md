# ðŸ›’ OpenCart Manual Testing Project

## ðŸ“– About This Project
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is my **end-to-end manual testing project** on the **OpenCart** e-commerce application (version 4.1.0.3).  
The goal was to simulate a real-world QA process â€” starting from requirement gathering, through detailed test design and execution, and ending with bug reporting and test closure.

I worked on this project as if I were part of a professional QA team:
- Documented requirements into an **FRS (Functional Requirement Specification)**.
- Created a **Test Plan** covering scope, strategy, and timelines.
- Designed **100+ test cases** for different functional areas.
- Executed all tests on a local OpenCart setup deployed using **XAMPP**.
- Reported bugs with proper screenshots and severity levels.
- Managed the Agile workflow entirely in **Jira with Zephyr**.

This project shows my ability to handle **real-world QA responsibilities** from scratch to sign-off.

## ðŸ“Œ My Testing Workflow

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Read and understood the OpenCart features.
   - Documented them in a clear **Functional Requirement Specification (FRS)**.

2. **Test Planning**
   - Prepared a **Test Plan** with:
     - Testing objectives and scope
     - Required resources
     - Entry/Exit criteria
     - Timelines and responsibilities

3. **Test Design**
   - Designed 100+ functional, negative, and UI test cases.
   - Maintained traceability between requirements and test cases (RTM).

4. **Test Execution**
   - Set up OpenCart locally using XAMPP.
   - Ran all test cases.
   - Recorded **Pass/Fail** status in Excel.
   - Took detailed bug screenshots for failed test cases.

5. **Defect Reporting**
   - Reported each defect in Jira.
   - Added reproduction steps, severity, and evidence.

6. **Agile Workflow in Jira**
   - Created Epic â†’ Backlog â†’ User Stories â†’ Sprint.
   - Linked test cases to Jira tasks.
   - Executed tests via Zephyr and tracked progress.
   - Generated Zephyr execution and traceability reports.
